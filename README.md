# Medical-students-Nutritional-Analysis-

--- 

## Introduction

This is an excel-based analysis of the data gotten from the XYB medical institute Canada.
The reason for this project is to have a general nutritional assessment of the newly admitted medical students. Thus, the goal is to determine how best to go about the feeding and to find out certain students who would need special attention in relation to their health and nutrition at large.

## Skills demonstrated in this project

- Data Cleaning.
- Pivot Tables.
- Pivot Chart.
- Data Visualization.
- Critical Thinking.
- Problem Solving.


## Problem Statement.

- To Evaluate the nutritional status of newly admitted medical students.
- To track the smoking and diabetic status of the students


## Data sourcing

After proper definition of my problem statement, I obtained the data by downloading the csv file from my drive and then imported and converted into an excel file. The data (medical students dataset) is a random dataset which was created by my instructor for the purpose of this class test. 
I cleaned the data, performed my analysis and created visualizations to help answer my questions.


## Data Transformation and cleaning
The Medical students dataset was not in a clean format, so I had to clean and transform it before I could create the visuals which was after I had created my pivot tables. The cleaning process, and all other subsequent analysis were done all done with excel.


Below are some of the steps I applied in cleaning the data:

- All the columns had some blank cells, so I identified the blank cells and filled them up with their respective supposed properties.
  
  - •	For columns with Numerical values like age, height, weight etc., I calculated the average of the cell and then filled the result in the blank cell. This however wasn`t the case in the column for student ID, as I used the flash fill feature to fill the column sequentially.
  - •	For the Gender column, I filled all the empty cells with “Female”. And the blank cells in the “blood type” column were filled with “O”.
  - •	For columns that required a “Yes /No” answer, I filled all the empty cells with unspecified.

- Although there were duplicate values, but being a random dataset that was just created for the sake of learning and practicing the advanced functions in excel, pivot tables and visualization, the inconsistencies and irregularities were all ignored.

- After this, I went straight to calculating the average values of the following:
   Age, Height, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood, Pressure and cholesterol.



## Analysis and visualization
  
I created very simple and easy-to-understand visuals. I used about six colors which were split differently in all six visualizations. They are bold and eye-catching, which helps to make the visuals more memorable. The aim is to make the visualization very easy to understand by anyone who views it irrespective of the level of expertise.
All six visuals passed different information all related to the analysis at hand.


They showed the following:

- The average biometrics of male students as well as female students.
- The average height and weight of the students (Male and Female respectively)
- The blood group classification of the students
- The smoking status of the students
- The diabetic status of the students.


**In the first visual**:

I showed the average biometrics of the students ranging from their BMI, Blood pressure, heart rate, Temperature, cholesterol and age.
I noticed that on average the male students were older than the female by just 0.07 and so could possibly pass as being of same age with the female students. However, they were lesser in their average temperature, BMI, blood pressure and heart rate; which is a pointer to the fact that they were taking more than required cholesterol for their age.
Below is the visual for proper understanding of this point:

**In the second visuals**, there is an indication that the students all fall under same age bracket because of the very slight difference in their average height and weight.
I however noticed that they girls who were taller had lesser weight and the boys who had more weight (on average) were lesser in height. This could thus mean that the boys had foods with more vitamin and lesser protein and the reverse was the case for the girls.  

Below is the visual:

In the third visual, we see that the blood type with the highest number of students is blood group “O” and the group with the least is blood group “A”.
below is what it looks like:

We see in the fourth visualization that there is a huge difference between the number of those who smoke and those who do not. Although there are some others whose status is undefined, but that isn`t our major concern.

The clear difference here shows that to a great extent, very many students wouldn`t complain of heart  or heart related diseases.


In the last visualization, we also notice that the margin between diabetic and non-diabetic students is great. Although few other students are unspecified but the emphasis is on the fact that the work load is reduced.

## Recommendations

- Considering that the students all fall on same age bracket considering the little difference in their average biometrics, but some group (male) consume more cholesterol which has distorted certain functions in them, I recommend that the boys minimize the intake of cholesterol and maximize the intake of protein to match the height of the female students and the female students on the other hand maximize the intake of vitamin contained foods, to match the weight of the boys.

- I noticed that the number of students who smoke is minimal compared to the total population thus is recommend that special and maximum attention be given these students since they make up not up to half of the school`s population, managing them would be easy.

- I also notice that the number of students who are diabetic is also small. One this note, I recommend special complete diets for the diabetic students. 

- Since it would be easy to attend to them, it would be proper that they are excluded entirely from the feeding meant for other students and provided with very different and special meal to match their health status.


## Conclusion

All the students who need attention as analyzed above should would be provided with proper attention. However, only the diabetic students should have a total change of meal course.
